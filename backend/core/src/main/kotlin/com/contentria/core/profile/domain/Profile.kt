/**
 * What other people see of an account: a name and a picture.
 *
 * Split from Account because the two are read by different callers for different reasons.
 * A profile is public, read constantly (every post, every blog header) and needs no
 * authorisation. An account is private, read once per login, and carries the email address
 * and role set. Keeping them in one table is what made rendering a post's author load an
 * email and join two authority tables, and what made a suspended author's published posts
 * fail to render at all.
 *
 * Single-entity aggregate. It has no members and no invariants beyond the display name.
