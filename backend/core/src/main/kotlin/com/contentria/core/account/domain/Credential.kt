/**
 * One way of proving ownership of an [Account]: a password, or a link to a social provider.
 *
 * A member of the Account aggregate, not a root. It has no identity outside the account it
 * belongs to, nothing else in the system references it, and it is only ever reached through
 * [Account]. Construction and mutation are therefore `internal` — [Account] is the only class
 * meant to call them.
 *
 * It deliberately holds no email address. The account owns the address; storing it here as
 * well is what left `users.email` and `credentials.email` as two copies of one value with no
 * code keeping them in step.
